## Invariance
	- If you cannot replace a type by any other type, then we call this type is invariant.
- ## Contravariance
	- If a type can be replaced by its _super type_, then we call this type is contravariant.
- ## Covariance
	- If a type can be replaced by its _sub type_, then we call this type is covariant.
